# FirebrickNodeJScriptingModule
This scripting engine is designed to be integrated with Firebrick 
(http://digitalfire.ucd.ie/?page_id=1011
https://github.com/leetobin )

Nevertheless, it can also run as a stand alone application, 
the starting page is index.js and in order to start the server, just type in node console
node index.js

## Usage
In order to be able to use it, there are several required tools to be installed:
1) Node.js ( follow instructions on http://nodejs.org/download/)
2) MongoDB (follow instructions on http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/administration/install-on-linux/)
3) mongodb driver for node - in order to install this, open console in the folder where scripting engine is located and run:
npm install mongodb


## Developing
In order to start developing, you additionally will need a development integration environment (IDE).
I use eclipse with nodejs plugin
(Eclipse installation: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse/Installation)
For nodejs plugin installation follow:
 -  Eclipse, then select Help > Install New Software...
 - Enter the update site URL into the Work with text box:
    http://www.nodeclipse.org/updates/
    or the one that is quicker but changes every release
    http://dl.bintray.com/nodeclipse/nodeclipse/0.16/
    Select with checkbox what you want to install.
    ("The more, the better" does not apply here.
    Take note of what features names you are installing.)
    Below is Enide-Recommended-Set-for-Nodejs for example.
